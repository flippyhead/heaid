(b Vienna,15 Aug 1960). Austrian composer, improviser and performer. He attended the Vienna Musikhochschule (1979--87), where he studied with Friedrich Cerha and Dieter Kaufmann, among others. He also studied musicology and art history at the University of Vienna (doctorate 1989; thesis published as "Das Synthese-Denken bei Anton Webern", Tutzing 1991). Active as a double bassist until 1984, he played in chamber and experimental jazz ensembles. As a composer he has contributed to the Projekt 3 composition programming environment of Gottfried Michael Koenig at Utrecht and Arnheim (1988-89) which later transformed into his own Realtime Composition Library (RTC-lib) for Max/MSP/Jitter. Essl also served as composer-in-residence at the Darmstadt summer courses (1990--94) and completed a commission for IRCAM. \
\
Between 1995 and 2006 he was teaching  computer-aided composition at the Studio for Advanced Music & Media Technology at the Bruckner University, Linz. Since 2007 he is professor of composition for electro-acoustic and experimental music at the University of Music and Performing Arts in Vienna, Austria. Furthermore, Karlheinz Essl is the music director of the Essl Museum (Vienna/ Klosterneuburg) where he curates experimental music events and sound installations.\
\
Essl's compositions result from confrontations between ordered, abstract models and original tonal, expressive structures. He has frequently sought to combine music with other genres and has collaborated with the graffiti artist Harald Naegeli (Partikel-Bewegungen, 1991), the writer Andreas Okopenko and the artists' group Libraries of the Mind (Lexikon-Sonate, 1992--8), the architect Carmen Wiederin (Klanglabyrinth, 1992-95) and the video artist Vibeke Sorensen (MindShipMind, 1996, a multimedia installation for the Internet). During the 1990s he carried out many additional projects for the Internet and became increasingly involved with improvisation. In 1997, Karlheinz Essl was featured at the Salzburg Festival with portrait concerts and sound installations. In 2003 and 2004 he acted as an artist-in-residence at the festival "Musik aktuell" (N\'85) and at the Brucknerhaus, Linz.\
\
Besides writing instrumental music, Karlheinz Essl also works in the field of electronic music, interactive realtime compositions and sound installations. He develops software environments for algorithmic composition and acts as a performer and improviser. Most of his compositions are published by TONOS (Darmstadt).\
\
Currently, Karlheinz Essl is working on a series of works entitled "Sequitur" (2008 ff.) for various solo instruments and live-electronics.\
