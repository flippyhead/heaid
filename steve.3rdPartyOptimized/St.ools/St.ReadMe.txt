Dear Maxers,This library of tools I need or I believe to need for my own needs is completely unfinished in terms of public preparation. But I think there is so much useful stuff in it, that I came to the conclusion I'd better pull it out to the world and program new tools, than sitting down and form it into a 'product'.Take it as inspiration and if you find bugs, or missing help files (usually means the patch is not finished yet and might be just a scetch of an idea), do not hesitate to send me an e-mail (Stefan-Tiedje@addcom.de) or just repair and modify it for your needs. (Of course I would like to be informed about those kind of repairs ;-)Most of the abstractions are named in the xx.name convention by prepending St. to the hopefully meanigfull name. The Exeption is a bunch of patchers I call 'abhaXions' some resemble exiting OS 9 externals for OSX, Pd externals, MSP versions of existing sceduler externals (metro~ for example) or just patchers which need to be named as they are (#  objects) and some are just too obvious and simple to name them differently. If you come accross an abhaXion which would create a nameclash, please let me know, I'll rename it with prepended 'St.'Please read the St.License, which has to be distributed with the tools.Stefan Tiedje [][]  [][][]  [][]  [][][]  [][]  [][][]  [][]  [][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][]        Stefan Tiedje          Klanggestaltung                               CD-Mastering           /~~~~~\             Elektronische    \\\   /|() ()|\             Komposition    ))))) )|  |  |( \\\        & Improvisation    ///    \ \_/)/ )))))                   \___/   ///        ----------------------------   14, Avenu du President Franklin Roosevelt-_____-----------|----------   94320 Thiais-(_|_ ----|\-----|-----()---   France- _|_)----|-----()----------   CCMIX   01-49 77 51 72---------()-----------------   Private   01-48 90 74 80
